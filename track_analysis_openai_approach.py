"""
DJ Mixing Pipeline: Simplified song selection using OpenAI.
Handles MP3 scanning and lets OpenAI parse any user request format and select songs directly.
Outputs 'analyzed_setlist.json' for the next pipeline stage (BPM lookup).

Features:
- Flexible input: works with specific counts, artists, moods, or "make a mix with all songs"
- OpenAI handles ALL parsing, selection, and ordering logic
- Single-pass selection for simplicity and reliability

2. Select the appropriate songs from the available library that match their request
3. Order the songs in a DJ-friendly sequence (good flow, energy progression)
4. If user doesn't specify a count, choose 10-15 songs for a good mix
5. If user says "all songs" or similar, include ALL available songs

Return ONLY a JSON object in this format:

IMPORTANT: 
- Return songs in the ORDER they should be mixed
- Use EXACT titles, artists, and filenames from the available library
- Prioritize any specific songs mentioned by the user
- Match artist names flexibly (e.g., "Anirudh" matches "Anirudh Ravichander")
