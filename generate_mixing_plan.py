# generate_mixing_plan.py
"""
This module generates a DJ mixing plan based on an analyzed setlist, producing a sequence of track transitions with
timing, transition types, and tempo adjustments. It uses audio metadata (e.g., BPM, key, vocals, choruses) to suggest optimal
transition types and calculates start times and overlaps for a seamless mix. The output is saved as a JSON file for use
in DJ software or event planning.

Key features:
- Estimates transition overlaps based on transition type (e.g., crossfade, EQ sweep, Chorus Beatmatch).
- Checks harmonic compatibility between tracks using key semitone differences.
- Computes OTAC (Optimal Tempo Adjustment Coefficient) for smooth tempo transitions.
- Suggests transition types based on BPM, key compatibility, vocal presence, and chorus availability for mid-song transitions.
- Supports "Chorus Beatmatch" transitions at the end of the outgoing track's chorus if beats align (BPM diff <= 2).
- Generates a mixing plan with start times, transition points, cut offsets, and comments for each track.

Dependencies:
- json: For parsing input setlist and serializing the mixing plan.
- os: For file path operations.
- numpy: For numerical computations (e.g., OTAC calculation).
- datetime, timedelta: For handling time calculations and formatting.
- pydub: For loading audio files to determine track durations.
