# generate_mixing_plan.py

"""
This module generates a DJ mixing plan based on an analyzed setlist, strictly enforcing 
the 'Chorus Beatmatch' transition type. The mix will prioritize a chain of tracks that 
are harmonically compatible, have choruses, and a BPM difference of 2 or less.

Key features:
- **STRICT ENFORCEMENT:** Only 'Chorus Beatmatch' is suggested if BPM difference <= 2 
  and both tracks have chorus data. Otherwise, a 'Crossfade' fallback is used (which 
  results in no complex transition in generate_mix for tracks that don't meet the rule).
- Prioritizes a chain of Chorus Beatmatch-ready tracks at the start of the mix.
- Estimates transition overlaps based on the Chorus Beatmatch type.
- Computes OTAC (Optimal Tempo Adjustment Coefficient) for smooth tempo transitions.
- Prevents a track from transitioning to itself.
- Generates a mixing plan with start times, transition points, cut offsets, and comments for each track.

Dependencies:
- json: For parsing input setlist and serializing the mixing plan.
- os: For file path operations.
- numpy: For numerical computations (e.g., OTAC calculation).
- datetime, timedelta: For handling time calculations and formatting.
- pydub: For loading audio files to determine track durations.
