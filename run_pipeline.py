# run_pipeline.py
"""
This module orchestrates the full AI DJ pipeline, integrating multiple stages to generate a DJ mix from user input.
It coordinates the track identification, track analysis, mixing plan generation, and final mix creation, producing
a seamless MP3 mix based on user preferences and local audio files.

Key features:
- Executes four main stages: track identification, track analysis, mixing plan generation, and mix generation.
- Uses logging to track progress and errors for debugging and monitoring.
- Validates the existence of intermediate output files (JSON and MP3) to ensure pipeline integrity.
- Handles errors gracefully, logging issues and raising exceptions for caller handling.

Dependencies:
- json: For reading intermediate JSON files.
- os: For file path operations and environment variable management.
- warnings: To suppress non-critical Numba warnings.
- logging: For detailed logging of pipeline execution.
- track_identification_engine: Generates the initial setlist from user input.
- track_analysis_engine: Analyzes tracks for audio features (e.g., BPM, key).
- generate_mixing_plan: Creates a mixing plan with transition types and timings.
- mixing_engine: Generates the final MP3 mix with applied transitions.

    2. Track Analysis: Analyzes tracks for audio features (e.g., BPM, key, energy).
    3. Mixing Plan: Creates a mixing plan with transition types, timings, and OTAC values.
